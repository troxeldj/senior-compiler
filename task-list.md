# Task List

A typical compiler operates in stages, a compiler can have a multitude of different stages. However, for my project there will be four distinct stages:
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing
3. Intermediate code Generation
4. Assembly (x86/x64) Code Generation


## Lexical Analysis Tasks
1. Research Lexical Analysis and what the purpose of lexical analysis is within a compiler
2. Research implementations of Lexical Analysis Components (Lexers) in current language compilers; such as CPython
3. Develop the lexical analysis component (lexer) of the compiler
4. Test and QA the lexical analysis component(s) of the compiler

## Parsing Tasks
5. Research Parsing and what the purpose of parsing is within a compiler
6. Research the various types of parsing (recursive descent, top-down, bottom-up, etc.) to find the best fit for the project
7. Research Implementations of Parsing Components (Parsers) in current language compilers; such as CPython
8. Develop the parsing component of the compiler
9. Test and QA the parsing component(s) for the compiler

## Code Generation Tasks
9. Research Intermediate code generation and common formats compilers use to generate intermediate forms (things such as three-address-code (TACS/3AC)).
10. Research intermediate code generation implementations in current language compilers; such as CPython
11. Develop the intermediate code generation component for the project's compiler
12. Research Assembly Code Generation implementations and how this process works in current compiler implementations; such as CPython
13. Develop the code generation component for the project's compiler

## Final QA Tasks
14. QA the compiler as a whole. Ensure the interaction between components is functioning and the compiler generates correct assembly code.

Note: I (Dillon Troxell) am the only member of my team (Mightnight squad), so all tasks will be assigned to me.
