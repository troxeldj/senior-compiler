# Project Sought
I want to build a custom compiled language. I want to implement a lexer, parser, and Generator from scratch. I will be using C++.

I have already started on this project and you can find the code in the [github repo](https://github.com/troxeldj/senior-compiler).

I have also been working with [William Hawkins](https://github.com/hawkinsw) for guidance and assistance.
