Senior Project C Compiler

A compiler that will compile a subset (nearly all features) of C into x86 assembly.
This code can then be assembled, linked, and ran.


See [User Docs](https://github.com/troxeldj/senior-compiler/blob/master/user-doc.md) for additional information on usage of the compiler.
